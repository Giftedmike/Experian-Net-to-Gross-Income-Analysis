# Experian-Net-to-Gross-Income-Analysis

Experian Credit Score Assessment Project, 

United Kingdom â€“ December 2023

Tools Used:

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

Python: For coding customized functions and calculations.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Techniques: To uncover data inconsistencies and extract insights.

Problem:

The main challenge was to accurately calculate annual gross income from monthly net income data provided by Experian. The datasets were limited, containing only location and monthly net income, which presented issues such as negative values and a lack of detailed attributes for a thorough analysis.

Action Taken:

Initial Brainstorming and Planning:

Conducted brainstorming sessions to define dataset attributes and determine suitable methodologies.
Partitioned the datasets into a test dataset and a holdout dataset.

Data Analysis:

Focused on the test dataset, using Python to calculate yearly net income based on monthly net income.
Conducted EDA to identify and address problems, such as negative monthly net revenues.
Expanded the analysis to the holdout dataset, creating a customized Python function to calculate projected annual gross income.

Comparative Examination:

Compared generated results with provided monthly net income, revealing a variance of less than 10%.

Solutions:

Customized Python Functions:

Developed to accurately calculate annual gross income, addressing discrepancies and improving prediction accuracy.

Data Optimization:

Employed EDA to optimize the limited data, extracting valuable insights despite constraints.

Model Evaluation:

Achieved a variance of less than 10% between calculated and expected incomes, demonstrating the methodology's effectiveness.

Summary:
The project successfully addressed the challenge of calculating annual gross income from limited monthly net income data. By leveraging Python for customized calculations and employing thorough EDA, the team was able to optimize the existing data and generate accurate predictions with a minimal margin of error. Despite limitations, the developed methodology provided significant insights into the financial characteristics of the datasets, underscoring the importance of continuous refinement and detailed documentation for future analyses.
